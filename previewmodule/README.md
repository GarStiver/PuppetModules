# My own module

The point of this module is to install eclipse and all the dependencies it requires to function as proper development enviroment for future software projects.

## Requirements

To get the enviroment working I figured I would need to install atleast java, mysql-server/client, apache2 and eclipse to get a proper enviroment working and running. Also to create a user for the mysql database and to make the module run the required updates when ever it is ran on a new system
