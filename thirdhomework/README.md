# Exercise 3: Configuring applications

### Disclaimer:

This post is for the Linux's centralized contro -course (ICT4TN011-11) held by Tero Karvinen in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences.

The puppet modules created during this exercise are free to use.

### PC in use:

OS: Xubuntu 16.04.1 LTS

CPU: AMD A10-4655 APU 2.0GHz

RAM: 8.00gb

### Preparations for the exercise

Before starting the actual exercise I did the necessary preparations as follows:

```
$sudo apt-get update

$sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```
## Starting the exercise

### Instructions

The objective of this exercise was to create a package configuration -module using Puppet and write a blog post about it using Git.

## The object of the exercise

The object of this exercise was to create two modules:

One that installs ssh and changes the default port to something else. In this case to 2222.

And a second module that install apache2 webserver and changes default website to something else.

I started with the ssh module.

### Creating the ssh module

```

class ssh{	
	package{"ssh":
		ensure => "installed",
	}
	
	service{"sshd":
		ensure => "running",
		enable => "true",
		require => Package["ssh"],
	}
	
	file{"/etc/ssh/sshd_config":
		content => template('ssh/sshd_config.erb'),
		require => Package["ssh"],
		notify => Service["sshd"],
	}
}
```
Above you can see the ssh module I created. I ran it with the following command.

```
sudo puppet apply --modulepath ~/PuppetModules/thirdhomework/modules/ -e 'classÂ {'ssh':}'
```
After running the module I got the following message. I already had the ssh installed before I ran the module so that is why the output does not indicate
that the ssh package has been installed. But it does indicate that the sshd_config file has changed and that the service is running after the changes have been made.
```

### Creating the apacheconf module

Next I decided to create the apacheconf module. I already had the basis for it from the previous homework so this did not require too much work to do. The module can be found below: 

```
class apacheconf {
	package{'apache2':
		ensure => 'installed',
	}

	service{'apache2':
		ensure => 'running',
		enable => 'true',
		require => Package['apache2'],
	}
	
	file{'/home/teemu/public_html':
		ensure => 'directory',
		owner => 'teemu',
		group => 'teemu',
	}
	
	file{'/home/teemu/public_html/index.html':
		ensure => 'file',
		content => "Hello World",
		owner => 'teemu',
		group => 'teemu',
	}

	file{'/etc/apache2/sites-available/teemu.conf':
		content => template('apacheconf/teemu.conf.erb'),
		require => Package['apache2'],
		owner => 'root',
		group => 'root',
	}
	
	file{'/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/teemu.conf':
		ensure => 'link',
		target => '/etc/apache2/sites-available/teemu.conf',
		notify => Service['apache2'],
		require => Package['apache2'],
	}
	
	file{'/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf':
		ensure => 'absent',
		notify => Service['apache2'],
		require => Package['apache2'],
	}
}
```
After creating the module I ran it with the following command:

```
$sudo puppet apply --modulepath ~/PuppetModules/thirdhomework/modules/ -e 'class {'apacheconf':}'
```

I received the following output. Here the first line tells us that the package has been installed. The next line tells us that the 000-default.conf has been removed from the sites-enabled directory. After this the module has created the public_html-directory and created the index.html file there with the content described above in the module.
After this the teemu.conf-file was created and the template was put there. And after creating the conf-file the link to the sites-enabled directory is created. And finally the apache2 has restarted after doing all of the above.

```

```

To actually see that the module worked I navigated to the localhost page on my browser and it showed the following page:
